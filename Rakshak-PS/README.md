Contains the backend ML model for a hackathon project. It was part of a suite of application - mobile app and a web app - and our project won the second prize in Product Hack, a IIIT Allahabad hackathon. 

The dataset used to train the model was scraped from a public log of crimes committed in Maharashtra. The model used is a Random Forest.
The dataset is not provided for now, since the code is put up here in public as proof-of-execution.
